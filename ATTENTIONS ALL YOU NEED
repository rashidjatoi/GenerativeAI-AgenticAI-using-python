LLM | RAG | Agentic AI | Workflow Orchestration 


things i have to learn more about it 
AI & Orchestration: n8n, LangGraph, CrewAI, RAG Architectures, Voice AI Agents, OpenAI/Anthropic APIs.

Development: Python (AI-assisted), SQL (PostgreSQL/pgvector), JavaScript/TypeScript, Git.

Cloud & DevOps: Azure (Functions, Cosmos DB), GitHub Actions, Docker.

10x Efficiency: Fine-tuned GPT-based agents to slash internal support resolution times.

60% Performance Boost: Engineered Redis caching and optimized database structures to reduce infrastructure load.

3x Workflow Acceleration: Automated mission-critical business processes using BPM and Python-based orchestration.
